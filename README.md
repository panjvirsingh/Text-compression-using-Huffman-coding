Text-compression-using-Huffman-coding
=====================================

This java project uses data structures like Binary Search Trees, Linked Lists, Priority Queues etc. and implements Huffman coding algorithm , to achieve a maximum compression rate of 46%. Code efficiency for big text files has been kept in mind and by the use of classes such as StringBuffer etc. , a file of size 50mb can be compressed in a mere 180 seconds.
